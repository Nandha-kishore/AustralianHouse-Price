# House Price Prediction

> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
> The goal is to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## Goal

The company wants to know:

- How well those variables describe the price of a house.

## Conclusions

- The Above grade living area square feet is one among the most significant term in deciding the price.
- Garage Area is also significant in deciding the price of the house.
- Overall quality is more imporant than the overall condition for deciding the price of the house.
- Low density residential areas are having higher price compared to high density from the dataset. This may also be due to the square feet at high density areas may be low.
